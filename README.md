# IR Track
Tracking two IR leds on a pair of glasses.
The LEDs allow fast and efficient head tracking

Shoutout to [Johnny Chung Lee](http://www.johnnylee.net/)

Hardware:
The wii remote IR filter ontop of a webcame + 2 IR leds taped to each end of a pair of glasses.

TODO:
- [ ] Make a class to track the IR Leds in real space.
- [ ] Make a 3d demo like the j. lee one


Notes:
Will be very useful for game dev. Or other kinds of tracking. 
Can It be integrated in Unity of Unreal?
